Debugging :- 

  Compile Time Debugging :-                                                  Run Time Debugging 
          1. before our program runs.                                                    1. while our program runs.
          2. static assert                                                               2. memory leaks        
          3. compiler                                                                    3. segmentation faults
          4. conservative                                                                4. exceptions
                            

Compile Erros :-
  1. Syntax erros
  2. uninitialized variables.
  3. accesiing a varible out of scope.
  4. lvalue required as left operand of assignment
  5. assert checked at compile time.
  6. static_assert checked at run time.
  
  
  using namespace std;


int main()
{
   assert(1 == 2 && "yes, maths is working"); //      a.out: main.cpp:17: int main(): Assertion `1 == 2 && "yes, maths is working"' failed.(core dumped)
   static_assert(1 == 2 && "yes, maths is working");   // main.cpp:17:3: error: static assertion failed
                                                         static_assert(1 == 2 && "yes, maths is working");
  
}

gcc main.c -wall -Werror -o main
-wall = all the warnings enable
-werror = all the errors enable

Debugging techniques :-
        1. printf debugging
            #define DEBUG 0
                #if DEBUG
               #endif
        2. delta debugging
        
 #segementation fault :- 

      int main()
      {
        int *ptr = NULL;
        printf("%d", *ptr);     //segmentaion fault 
        
        int a[10];
        a[10000] = 7;  //segmentaion fault 
        
        a[11] = 7;  //stack smashing detected. core dumped
        
        
        A buffer overflow is dangerous, so the compiler uses various protection mechanisms to guard against it. One such mechanism is a canary. A canary is a randomly generated      value, â€‹and in the case of a buffer overflow, the canary is overwritten; when, upon comparison with the known value, the compiler detects that the stack was compromised it     throws the stack smashing detected error.

# gdb extra features   
   
g0 produces no debug information

-g1 produces some information, but no line numbers

-g2 is the default level that we have been using (same as -g). We get line numbers, symbols, file information at this level.

-g3 can include further information such as macros

-ggdb produces debug information specific to gdb. This is like -g3, and will try to generate as much information as possible.

This can be very handy if you really have a tough problem to debug.
